JSON is a data format that has its own independent standard and libraries for most programming languages.
JSON supports plain objects, arrays, strings, numbers, booleans, and null.
JavaScript provides methods JSON.stringify to serialize into JSON and JSON.parse to read from JSON.
Both methods support transformer functions for smart reading/writing.
If an object has toJSON, then it is called by JSON.stringify.

In simple cases of circular references, we can exclude an offending property from serialization by its name.

But sometimes we canâ€™t just use the name, as it may be used both in circular references and normal properties. So we can check the property by its value.

Write replacer function to stringify everything, but remove properties that reference meetup:
_solution_

let room = {
  number: 23
};

let meetup = {
  title: "Conference",
  occupiedBy: [{name: "John"}, {name: "Alice"}],
  place: room
};

room.occupiedBy = meetup;
meetup.self = meetup;

alert( JSON.stringify(meetup, function replacer(key, value) {
  return (key != "" && value == meetup) ? undefined : value;
}));

/*
{
  "title":"Conference",
  "occupiedBy":[{"name":"John"},{"name":"Alice"}],
  "place":{"number":23}
}
*/
